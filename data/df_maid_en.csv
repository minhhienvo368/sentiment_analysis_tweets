#Maid is such a solid and poignant drama with a fantastic #MargaretQualley. There are so many authentic ideas in it that genuinely build the entire narrative around domestic abuse and its repercussions. It reminds me of that distinctive high-quality in the early days of #Netflix.  https://t.co/1m1pfZgjG6,ilovemoviesmor1,18,2021-10-05
