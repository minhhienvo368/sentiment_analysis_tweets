"Fr Paul wants so badly for his version of reality to be true that he can reinterpret anything, even openly lie, to fit his story. Which, to varying degrees, we all do. Confirmation bias.

@bethfelkerjones My first thought (that I haven't been able to shake): how well #MidnightMass portrayed the reality that evil is perfectly willing to adopt religious language and symbols and practices to justify itself. The ease with which that happened in the show was horrifying and relatable.,kaitlynschiess,62,2021-10-11

#MidnightMass a good example of televison being unsettling without being compelling.
